README file for Bonmin

Bonmin (Basic Open-source Nonlinear Mixed INteger programming) is an
open-source code for solving general MINLP (Mixed Integer NonLinear
Programming) problems.

It is distributed on COINOR (www.coin-or.org) under the CPL (Common Public
License). The CPL is a license approved by the OSI (Open Source
Initiative), thus Bonmin is OSI Certified Open Source Software.

Bonmin features several algorithms
 - B-BB is a NLP-based branch-and-bound algorithm,
 - B-OA is an outer-approximation decomposition algorithm,
 - B-QG is an implementation of  Quesada and Grossmann's branch-and-cut
 algorithm,
 - B-Hyb is a hybrid outer-approximation based branch-and-cut algorithm.


Bonmin documentation consists of a users' manual and a refernece
manual they may be found on-line at the project web-site or can be built
from the project source distribution. Instructions are provided in the
INSTALL file.
