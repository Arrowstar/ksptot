The COIN-OR Cut Generation Library is a collection of cut 
generators that can be used with other COIN-OR projects that make 
use of cuts, such as, among others, the linear solver Clp or the 
mixed integer linear programming solvers Cbc or BCP. 

Each cut generator is in a separate directory with its own maintainer. 
Maintainer names are listed in the AUTHORS file in the Cgl directory.
