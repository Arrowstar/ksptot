# Definition of the variables with bounds
var x {i in 1..4}, >= 1, <= 50;

# objective function
minimize obj:
  x[1]*x[4]*(x[1] + x[2] + x[3]) + x[3];

# and the constraints
subject to c1:
  -2*x[1] + x[2] + x[3] - x[4] <= 25;

subject to c2:
  x[1]+x[2]+x[3]+x[4] = 40;

# Now we set the starting point:

let x[1] := 1;
let x[2] := 5;
let x[3] := 5;
let x[4] := 1;
