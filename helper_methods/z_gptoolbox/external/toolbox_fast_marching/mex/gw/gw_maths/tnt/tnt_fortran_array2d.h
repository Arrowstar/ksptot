/**
	Templated two-dimensional, numerical array which
	looks like a conventional Fortran array.  This is 
	useful when integrating with C/C++ codes translated
	from Fortran.  Storage corresponds to conventional Fortran ordering.
	That is, the left-most dimension varies fastest.
	Indexing is via the A(i,j) notation and A(1,1)
	is the first element.
	
	<p>
	Array assignment is by reference (i.e. shallow assignment).
	That is, B=A implies that the A and B point to the
	same array, so modifications to the elements of A
	will be reflected in B. If an independent copy
	is required, then B = A.copy() can be used.  Note
	that this facilitates returning arrays from functions
	without relying on compiler optimizations to eliminate
	extensive data copying.

	<p>
	This class employs its own garbage collection via
	the use of reference counts.  That is, whenever
	an internal array storage no longer has any references
	to it, it is destoryed.
