function pos = linePosition3d(point, line)
%LINEPOSITION3D Return the position of a 3D point projected on a 3D line.
%
%   T = linePosition3d(POINT, LINE)
%   Computes position of point POINT on the line LINE, relative to origin
%   point and direction vector of the line.
%   LINE has the form [x0 y0 z0 dx dy dy],
%   POINT has the form [x y z], and is assumed to belong to line.
%   The result T is the value such that POINT = LINE(1:3) + T * LINE(4:6).
%   If POINT does not belong to LINE, the position of its orthogonal
%   projection is computed instead. 
%
%   T = linePosition3d(POINT, LINES)
%   If LINES is an array of NL lines, return NL positions, corresponding to
%   each line.
%
%   T = linePosition3d(POINTS, LINE)
%   If POINTS is an array of NP points, return NP positions, corresponding
%   to each point.

% vector from line origin to point
dp = bsxfun(@minus, point, line(:,1:3));

% direction vector of the line
vl = line(:, 4:6);

% precompute and check validity of denominator
denom = sum(vl.^2, 2);
invalidLine = denom < eps;
denom(invalidLine) = 1;

% compute position using dot product normalized with norm of line vector.
pos = bsxfun(@rdivide, sum(bsxfun(@times, dp, vl), 2), denom);

% position on a degenerated line is set to 0
pos(invalidLine) = 0;
