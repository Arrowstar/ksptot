          The solution has been evaluated in terms of log(x+1) or tan(x*pi/2), we
          now need the conic. As for transfer angles near to pi the Lagrange-
          coefficients technique goes singular (dg approaches a zero/zero that is
          numerically bad) we here use a different technique for those cases. When
          the transfer angle is exactly equal to pi, then the ih unit vector is not
          determined. The remaining equations, though, are still valid.
